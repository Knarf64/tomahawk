/**
 * @brief The CredentialsManager class holds an in-memory cache of whatever credentials are stored
 * in the system's QtKeychain-accessible credentials storage.
 * After instantiating the class, loadCredentials should be called, and this is the only time a read
 * operation from QtKeychain is performed. When CredentialsManager emits ready(), it can be used for
 * all other operations. The only QtKeychain operations performed at any time after startup are
 * write and delete.
 * This ensures an illusion of synchronous operations for Tomahawk's Account classes, even though all
 * QtKeychain jobs are async.
